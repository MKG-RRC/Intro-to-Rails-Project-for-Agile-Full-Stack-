    UniCatalog is a Rails-based web application designed to catalog universities, their programs, departments, and instructors.

  <h2>Data Sources</h2>
  <p>
    The dataset for this project was generated using the <strong>Faker gem</strong>,
    which acts as my primary data source. Faker produces randomized yet realistic values
    for university names, academic programs, department subjects, instructor names, and email addresses.
  </p>
  <p>
    The data is seeded automatically through the <code>db/seeds.rb</code> file, which populates
    over 300 records across four tables:
    <ul>
      <li>Universities</li>
      <li>Programs</li>
      <li>Departments</li>
      <li>Instructors</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    All relationships follow the one-to-many and many-to-many associations defined in the ERD diagram below.
  </p>

  <h2 class="mt-4">Entity Relationship Diagram</h2>
  <p>
    The diagram below shows the database schema, where one University has many Programs and Departments,
    and Programs and Instructors share a many-to-many relationship.
